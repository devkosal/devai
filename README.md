# Intro

This repo contains my `base_code`. Most of it is designed for deep learning tasks. `base_code/utils.py` contains some none deep learning functions.

Example usages:

```
git clone https://github.com/devkosal/base_code
cd base_code
pip install -e .
```

Or

```
sys.path.append("/Users/devsharma/Projects/base_code")
from base_code.utils import tree_view
```
